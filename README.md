# Dilli AI
This is the repo for a Supreme Commander Forged Alliance AI :)

Main design goals can be summarised as follows...


## 1) Superior 1v1 performance
The current set of AIs in SCFA are fine, but they aren't representative of how higher level humans play.

Dilli AI, and variations thereof, are designed to try and close that gap.



## 2) Make AI modding more accessible
AI modding in SCFA really isn't that hard, and some better AI could really help improve the game.
One of the goals of this AI is to help guide others seeking to make their own AI.

Besides, its no fun making AI if nobody else is making AI for you to beat :)
